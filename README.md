## What is the Aviator Game?

Aviator is a \"crash\" game that revolves around a simple yet engaging
concept. The game features a plane that starts flying, and your goal is
to cash out before the plane crashes. The plane's altitude increases
with every second, but if it crashes before you cash out, you lose your
bet. The thrill of the game lies in deciding when to cash out, as you
never know exactly when the plane will crash.

The game has become a global sensation, and many online casinos now
offer it as part of their mobile and desktop gaming portfolio.
